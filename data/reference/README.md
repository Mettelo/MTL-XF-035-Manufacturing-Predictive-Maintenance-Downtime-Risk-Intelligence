# MTL-XF-035 — References and mappings

Retain source documentation, licence/citation notices and required codebooks for AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance. Preserve actual header spellings, field types and original row order; distinguish identifiers, predictors and outcomes.

Version each reference with ID, official URL, retrieval date/version, content checksum, rights, raw→display mapping, rationale, owner and reviewer. Unknown categories remain visible; validate mapping completeness/uniqueness and all many-to-many joins.

**Interpretation rule:** Failure-mode flags are outcomes and cannot be features for predicting Machine failure. Product IDs and row IDs are excluded from predictors. The data do not prove predictive lead time, remaining useful life or realised maintenance savings.

**Project policy assumptions:** Compare a tool-wear rule (Tool wear≥200 min, project baseline) against model top 5% inspection risk ranking. Show top 2%, 5%, 10% capacity scenarios; threshold/capacity is chosen on validation only. Missed-failure:inspection cost ratios 10:1 and 50:1 are assumptions.

Keep choices separate from publisher facts. Register categorical/segment/class labels, unit conversions and any financial or capacity assumptions. Do not invent operational history absent from S1.

A reference explains the source; it cannot supply an unmeasured outcome. Register supplements and scope changes in [SOURCE_REGISTER.md](../SOURCE_REGISTER.md) before dependent work.
